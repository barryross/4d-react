## Overview

This is my website for my freelance development & consulting business, http://www.4d-media.com

It is a React app based off of Create React App, and the data is populated from a Node.js backend built with <a href="https://keystonejs.com/">Keystone.js</a>

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- React
- Semantic UI
- Fontello (custom icons)

## Ideas for future refactoring

- Make better use of Semantic-UI components/classes and reduce amount of custom CSS
- Make CTA component dynamic and accept props for content and button
- Ensure consistent use of media query mixin over standard media query syntax
