    "content":"When we first met, Barry had planned to help me set up the guts of my website. But because his expertise spanned far beyond that of a developer, meetings with him began to include business plans, a logo and a clearer direction for my company. Our discussions helped me better identify a mission statement.  His instinct for business, technical background, and natural teaching abilities, make him an excellent partner/sounding board for startups like mine - or anyone looking to refresh an existing brand.",
